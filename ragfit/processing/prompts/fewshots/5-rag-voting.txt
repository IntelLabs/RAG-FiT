Question: Which band top the UK charts with their singles "Chelsea Dagger" and "Whistle for the Choir": The Fratellis or The Madden Brothers?
Context:
The Fratellis: The Fratellis are a Scottish rock band from Glasgow, formed in 2005. The band consists of three unrelated members, who perform under pseudonyms: lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli, bassist Barry Fratelli, and drummer Mince Fratelli. Their singles "Chelsea Dagger" and "Whistle for the Choir" were both top ten hits in the UK charts.
Whistle for the Choir: "Whistle for the Choir" is a song by Scottish rock band the Fratellis. It was released on 27 November 2006 as the band's third single and reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart, marking their second UK top-10 single. In the band's native Scotland, the song reached number two, becoming their second song to reach that position after "Chelsea Dagger".
Chelsea Dagger: "Chelsea Dagger" is a song by Scottish rock band the Fratellis. It was released as the second single from their debut studio album, Costello Music (2006), on 28 August 2006. It is named after Jon Fratelli's wife Heather, a burlesque dancer whose stage name – a play on Britney Spears – he borrowed for the song.
Half Drunk Under a Full Moon: Guitarist and vocalist Jon Fratelli had previously sought this approach on their debut album's most successful single, "Chelsea Dagger": "I wasn't mad keen on going down the road of the chant vocals. I really wanted to have a New Orleans big band playing. But Tony Hoffer, our producer, had us doing multiple vocal takes from all around the studio."
The Brothers (band): The Brothers (also referenced in some sources as simply Brothers) were a UK-based band that scored a top ten hit on the British chart with the song, "Sing Me." The sprightly, reggae-inflected song reached number 8 on the UK Singles Chart in the Spring of 1977. The band consisted of 5 real brothers with the surname Bayou - Clarel (lead vocals), Lindsay (guitar), Gervais (keyboards and guitar), Daniel (bass) and Clarey (drums).
