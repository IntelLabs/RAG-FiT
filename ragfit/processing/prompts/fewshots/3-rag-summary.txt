Half Drunk Under a Full Moon: Guitarist and vocalist Jon Fratelli had previously sought this approach on their debut album's most successful single, "Chelsea Dagger": "I wasn't mad keen on going down the road of the chant vocals. I really wanted to have a New Orleans big band playing. But Tony Hoffer, our producer, had us doing multiple vocal takes from all around the studio."
The Brothers (band): The Brothers (also referenced in some sources as simply Brothers) were a UK-based band that scored a top ten hit on the British chart with the song, "Sing Me."
